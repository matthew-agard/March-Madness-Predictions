    "Naturally, it will be vitally important to scrape available data that is pertinent to deciding the outcome of an NCAA March Madness game between any two given teams. To successfully do so, we must break down what are generally the most influential elements of a basketball team's success.\n",

    "<br>Overall team performance during the regular season is generally a good indicator of how a team will perform in March Madness. This would be captured by statistics, both basic and advanced, such as the following:\n",
    "<br>**Season Record (%)\n",
    "<br>Conference Record (%); could be important given that the tournament is split into regions\n",
    "<br>Regular Season Record vs. Tourney Opponent (%); set to theoretical discrete probability of 50% if no such matchups exist \n",
    "<br>Strength of Schedule (SOS); measures the difficulty of the teams played (higher number = greater difficulty)\n",
    "<br>Top 25 Ranking (boolean); considered a consensus top-tier team\n",
    "<br>Shots Made per Game (FG, 3P, FT)\n",
    "<br>Point Differential per Game; measures how dominant/unsuccessful you are at outscoring your opponent on average\n",
    "<br>Misc. Team Stats per Game (Rebounds, Assists, Blocks, etc.)**\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>It's important to note that in the NCAA, more so than the NBA, experienced coaches can have just as much of an impact on a game's outcome as the players themselves. Hence, it's reasonable to assume that the following statistics could also be solid indicators:\n",

    "<br>Coach Sweet Sixteen Appearances\n",
    "<br>Coach Final Four Appearances\n",
    "<br>Coach Championships Won**\n",

    "Recall that our cleaned dataset has a total of 1,747 March Madness games present, and each March Madness will consist of no more than 67 games (4 play-in games + 63 tournament games). As can be seen below, the advanced stats pertaining to personal fouls (PF) and turnovers (TOV) are the only features listed with no more than a season's worth of missing data. Given how rapidly the gameplay of college basketball has evolved over the time horizon of our dataset, imputing nulls on multiple years of March Madness data would likely be a futile effort. The features with a high volume of nulls (1> season) will be dropped from the dataset."
