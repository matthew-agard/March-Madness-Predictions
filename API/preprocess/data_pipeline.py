"""Data Pipeline Helper Functions

This script is used as a module in the March_Madness_Predictions Jupyter notebooks.

The following functions are present:
    * regular_season_stats
    * team_ratings
    * coach_performance
    * all_team_season_data
    * hist_tournament_games
    * dataset_pipeline
    * feature_pipeline
    * round_pipeline
    * bracket_pipeline

Requires a minimum of the 'pandas' library, as well as the 'data_fetch', 'data_clean',
'data_merge', and 'feature_engineering' helper modules, being present in your environment to run.
