# Creating the Perfect Bracket

There's nothing quite like the most riveting basketball event of the year: NCAA March Madness. The 64-team tournament consists of 4 regions, each with 16 teams ranked independently of the other regions according to their regular season performance. Each team attempts to win 6 successive games in order to emerge victorious as the NCAA national champion.

Perhaps what contributes most to the intrigue of March Madness is filling out a March Madness bracket. "The American Gaming Association estimated in 2019 that 40 million Americans filled out a combined 149 million brackets for a collective wager of \$4.6 billion." It's important to note that even a single bet can be quite lucrative, particularly when an upset occurs (when a lower-ranking underdog beats a higher-ranking favorite). For example, the first-ever upset of a #1 seed by a #16 seed occurred in the 2019 NCAA tournament. In that game "a \$100 bet paid out \$2,500", which translates to American betting odds of +2500!

# Problem Structure

The purpose of this personal project is to perform supervised classification on March Madness data to more accurately predict the outcome of an NCAA tournament games--particularly the occurrence of upsets. This would allow for an increased possibility of yielding the kinds of profits mentioned above by filling out more accurate brackets relative to other participants.

# Setup
### Environment

### Run Notebook
...also in the works...

# TODO
-Write documentation for notebook decision-making & visualizations<br>
-Refactor various API components (feature engineering, data cleaning, pipelines)<br>
-Rewrite web scraper for fetching historical March Madness data<br>
-Assess feasibility of feature additions: conference, conference W-L%<br>
-Apply fit_transform() to training set only, else transform() (in feature pipeline)<br>
-start_bracket_from_round() functionality; could be used to overwrite predictions and recreate bracket from there<br>
-Experiment with neural networks and gradient-boosted trees (develop for March Madness 2022 and beyond)<br>
-Flesh out README "Setup" section
